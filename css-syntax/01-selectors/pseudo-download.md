# Task 3

In this task, we want you to make the following changes without adding to the
HTML:

- Style links, making the link-state orange, visited links green, and remove the
  underline on hover.
- Make the first element inside the container font-size: 150% and the first line
  of that element red.
- Stripe every other row in the table by selecting these rows and giving them a
  background color of `#333` and foreground of white.
