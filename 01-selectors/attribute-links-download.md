# Task 5

In this task, add CSS using attribute selectors to do the following:

- Target the `<a>` element with a `title` attribute and make the border pink
  (`border-color: pink`).
- Target the `<a>` element with an `href` attribute that contains the word
  `contact` somewhere in its value and make the border orange
  (`border-color: orange`).
- Target the ``<a>`` element with an `href` value starting with `https` and
  give it a green border (`border-color: green`).
