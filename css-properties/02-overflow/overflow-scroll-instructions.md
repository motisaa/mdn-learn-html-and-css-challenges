# Task 1

In this task, the content is overflowing the box because it has a fixed height.
Keep the height but cause the box to have scrollbar only if there is enough
text to cause an overflow. Test by removing some of the text from the HTML, that
if there is only a small amount of text that does not overflow, no scrollbar
appears.
