# Task 2

In this task, you have a box, which contains another box. Your task is to make
the inner box 60% of the width of the outer box. The value of the box-sizing
property is set to `border-box`, which means that the total width includes any
padding and border. You should also give the inner box padding of 10% using the
width (or inline size) as the size from which that percentage is calculated.
