# Task 3

In this task, you have two images in boxes. One image is smaller than the box,
the other is larger and breaking out of the box. If you imagine that the box is
responsive and therefore could grow and shrink, which property would you apply
to the image so that the large image shrinks down into the box but the small
image does not stretch.
