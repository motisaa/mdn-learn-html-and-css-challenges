# Task 2

In this task, we want you to make your changes by leveraging the
[order of cascade
layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance#order_of_cascade_layers)
section. Edit an existing declaration, without touching the lightgreen
declaration, using the cascade layer order to make the links rebeccapurple.
